## Welcome!

Here is my quick attempt at a simple React application that displays lovely dogs from the dog api (https://docs.thedogapi.com/). I traditionally have used Flask and other server side rendered structures for web development, so this was a fun challenge. 

### Please note: public API key provided was removed from this repo for security reasons.

## Prerequeisites

- Node JS

## Instrutions
1. Run create-react-app in a blank folder of your choice
2. Replace the contents of /public and /src with those found in this repo
3. run npm start to test locally
